**Short Bio.** I graduated with a Bachelor in Biomedical Engineering from the University of Naples in 2018. I then completed my Master's degree in Biomedical Engineering from the same institution in 2021, specializing in Medical Devices. In September 2021, I joined the Biomedical Imaging and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at IRCCS Synlab SDN. Since November 2022, I have been pursuing my PhD at the University of Naples Federico II. My research focuses on developing AI-based methods to support clinical decisions in medical imaging.
